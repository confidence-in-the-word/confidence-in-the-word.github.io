When Moses had conveyed them to the people he then wrote them down (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:3-4&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:3-4</a>). After completing this task he publicly read the newly composed <i>Book of the Covenant</i>, after which he ratified the agreement between the Lord and his people by sprinkling the blood from a sacrifice over them (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:7-8&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:7-8</a>). It was only on a subsequent encounter with the Lord that he was given the stone tablets which God himself had inscribed (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:12;31:18&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:12 and 31:18</a>).</p>
<p align="justify">In a similar way, when God repeated his commands, he first of all gave them verbally to Moses (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34:10-26&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 34:10-26</a>), and only then writes them on the stone tablets which Moses had taken with him up Mount Sinai, as the Lord instructed him (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34:1-4;34:27-28&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 34:1-4 and 34:27-28</a>). The significant difference was that, although Moses had destroyed the original set of tablets in his anger at seeing the people's idolatry (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32:19&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 32:19</a>), the <i>Book of the Covenant</i> would have still been intact. There was, therefore, no need for him to write it a second time. However, the stone tablets inscribed with the commandments - <i>the Testimony</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+31:18;32:15&language=english&version=NIV">Exodus 31:18 and 32:15 (NIV-UK)</a>) - needed to be replaced so there would be a tangible witness to the covenant God had made with his people.</p>
<p align="justify">Nearly forty years later, in preparation for the entry into Canaan, Moses wrote further collections of laws at God's instruction (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:9; 31:24-26&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:9 and 31:24-26)</a>), together with the words of the song he was to teach to the assembled people of Israel (see <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:19&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>, and <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:30-32:43&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:30-32:43</a> for the song itself). Moses' exhortation to the assembly of Israel after he had recited the song is applicable to all readers of any part of the Scriptures - <i>"These instructions are no mere words - they are your life!"</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+32:47&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 32:47)</a>.

... testifies to his inspiration in a rather less direct way. In <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John+4:6&language=english&version=NLT">1 John 4:6</a> he offers a test for deciding between true and false teaching: what agreed with the teaching he had given was to be accepted as true: what did not agree with his teaching was to be rejected as false.</p>
<p align="justify">This was not because John was conceited, but simply because he knew that what he taught was the truth. He had been present when Jesus had spoken about the coming of the Holy Spirit (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:26;16:13-14&language=english&version=NLT">John 14:26 and 16:13-14</a>), which he, together with the other apostles and many other believers, had received at Pentecost (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2:1-4&language=english&version=NLT">Acts 2:1-4</a>).</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, John had the witness of his own hearing, sight and touch that what he was writing about was true (see <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John+1:1-5&language=english&version=NLT">1 John 1:1-5</a>).</p>

<p align="justify">... whom many consider to be the same person as the apostle John, states that he wrote the Book of Revelation as a circular letter to the seven churches in the Province of Asia (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:4&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 1:4</a>) at the personal instruction of the Lord Jesus, <i>the living one who died</i> and who is now <i>alive forever and ever!</i> as a record of <i>the things that are now happening and ... will happen later</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:10-11;1:18-19&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 1:10-11 and 1:18-19</a>). John also records that the seven individual letters which immediately follow were written by direct dictation from the Lord (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:1;2:8;2:12;2:18;3:1;3:7;3:14&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 2:1, 2:8, 2:12, 2:18, 3:1, 3:7 and 3:14</a>). 
The full title of the book we often refer to simply as 'Revelation' is 'The 
Revelation of (<i>or</i> to) (St) John the Divine'. </p>
<p align="justify">John tells us there were three further occasions when he was directly commanded to write (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+14:13;19:9;21:5&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 14:13, 19:9 and 21:5</a>), but is careful 
also to record that there was one event he was forbidden to record (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+10:4&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 10:4</a>).</p>



<p align="justify"><font face="Maiandra GD" size="2">John's testimony serves to remind us that 
the Scriptures are, quite literally, a Divine revelation to the human race. We can know only as much about God and his purposes as he has chosen to 
tell us. To attempt to know more is futile (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+11:7-9&language=english&version=NLT">Job 11:7-9</a>), since God's thoughts and ways are incomprehensible to us (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55:8-9;Romans+11:33-36&language=english&version=NLT">Isaiah 55:8-9 and Romans 11:33-36</a>). Therefore, we must not attempt 
either to add to, or subtract from, God's Word (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians+4:6&language=english&version=NIV">1 Corinthians 4:6 (NIV-UK)</a> and <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22:18-19&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 22:18-19</a>). 
Yet, by a process we cannot begin to understand, God's Word, whether spoken or 
written, will always accomplish what he intends for it everywhere he sends it (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55:10-11&language=english&version=NLT">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>), 
and when accepted for what it truly is, will always have a remarkable effect
