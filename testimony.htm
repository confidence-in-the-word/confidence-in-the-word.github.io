<td bgcolor="white" valign="top"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><a name="section">In this, our second main section,</a>
we invite you to undertake a number of practical exercises each of
which involves reading and interpreting the Scriptures. Some may seem
elementary, but if you approach them in the way we have already
suggested in <a href="approach.htm#3r">Approaching the Bible</a> we
are certain the Lord will use them to enhance your confidence in your
ability to understand and apply the Scriptures, and that by doing so
you will experience something of the Bible's <b><i>power</i></b> - its unique ability to speak to you, today.</font><p></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">There is, of course, no obligation to
tackle everything we offer in the following pages! Simply choose
whatever is most appropriate for your own particular interests and
concerns.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><a name="recommendation">However, there is one recommendation</a> we do make for you to gain the greatest benefit from these exercises. It is that you <i>transcribe</i>
the references we have given, preferably by writing each one out by
hand. It is one thing to read the Bible for yourself; it is quite
another to copy Scripture. We are convinced there is great benefit to
be gained from manually transcribing the Word of God, as the remarkable
events related on this page testify.</font></p></td>

<p align="center"><font size="1">Report by KAREN CARTER</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A project to write out the Bible by hand led to a
"miraculous" change in the life of woman who had suffered severe
exhaustion and depression for over a year.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The conditions had left Sandy Watts, of Bristol,
without a desire to speak or the ability to write. "I couldn't be
bothered with anything," she said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">But a plea from the Bible project organiser at her
home church prompted Sandy to have a go, with God answering her prayer
for help in ways she could never have expected.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Steve Goddard, of Fishponds Baptist Church, had
launched the scheme last autumn in response to information from Open
Doors. "Many believers in the persecuted church write out the Bible,"
he said. "I thought it would be a good idea if we could do the same,
helping us to identify with Christians in places like China. In fact,
it also helped us to work together as a church, with God doing
wonderful things for many people along the way."</font></p>
<p><font size="2">After getting the go-ahead from Fishponds minister,
the Rev David Plumridge, Steve divided up the 1,189 chapters and
organised a rota of some 150 "scribes".</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Sandy said: "When Steve first mentioned it, I
couldn't read or write because my mind had just blown with stress.
Speech was also really difficult, because I didn't really want to speak
to anyone."</font></p>

<table align="right" border="1" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" width="14%">
<tbody><tr bgcolor="white">
<td bg="" color="white" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="1">Read the two passages of Scripture which so helped Sandy:</font><p></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37:1-14&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV">Ezekiel 37:1-14 (NIV)</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+116&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 116 (NIV)</a></font></p></td>
</tr>

<p><font size="2">But the former secretary knew that God was with her
when Steve dished out the first passage for her to copy: "It was
Ezekiel and the dry bones. At first I didn't think much about it, but
then I realised it was a passage that had been given to me several
years previously when I was ill with a blood condition. Steve had no
way of knowing that this particular passage had meant such a lot to me.
At first the writing out of the passages was so hard - I used to have
to keep my finger on a single word, copy it, and move on to the next
one.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">"But then I really knew that God was helping me
because when Steve gave me the next passage it was Psalm 116 - another
one that had been extremely important to me earlier on in my life. It
was like God was saying to me: 'I've helped you before and I'll do it
again. Don't worry, just trust me.'"</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Sandy went on to do several further passages. "As I
continued, so God began to work, because I hadn't been able to
co-ordinate at all, or spell even the simplest word. I have been a
secretary all my life and it was quite frightening to think that I
couldn't do any of it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">"I'd also found it very difficult to speak to people,
and I hadn't been able to go to church over the past year. I'd walk in
and just walk out again - and yet just a couple of weeks ago, the Lord
gave me the strength to stand up in church and give my testimony.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">"I had felt so far away from the Lord and yet I never
lost my faith and trust in God. I know I was crying all the way
through, and I suppose this is his answer. At one time I really thought
I was going mad, and I couldn't imagine myself ever being right again,
so it's sort of miraculous to think that simply writing out God's Word
can bring about these changes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">"I believe these passages were not just given to me
at random, the Lord knew just what I needed to fix my feet firmly on
the rock, and go forward in my life with him."</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Steve Goddard, who's now preparing to hand over the
finished Bible to Open Doors on 12 March, said: "It just shows the
power of the Word of God."
