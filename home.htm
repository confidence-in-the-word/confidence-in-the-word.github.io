<div class="justify">
<p><b>If this
statement is true - and we
believe it is - then it is vitally important for every Christian to
read his or her Bible regularly.</b></p>
<p>Yet, as the result of <a href="research.htm">research</a>
by two respected Christian organisations, confirmed by his own
observations, the <a href="author.htm">author</a>
of this website has become intensely aware that, apart from attendance at public
worship, many sincere believers neither read the Bible nor hear it
read, or if they do so, then it is only on rare occasions.</p>
<p>This has served to
convince the author
that the underlying reason for the lack of personal Bible reading in
the UK is that many Christians have suffered a fundamental <i style="font-style: italic;">loss of confidence</i>,
not only in the Bible itself, but also in their
God-given ability - and right - to read and understand the Scriptures
for themselves. He has therefore compiled <span class="citw">Confidence
in the Word</span> as a modest contribution
towards restoring and enhancing much-needed assurance among believers
that:-</p>
</div>
<ol type="n">
<li class="justify">
<p><i><b>The
Bible is the unique, authentic, authoritative and completely reliable
Word of God.</b></i></p>
<p>
By considering some of the things the Bible says about itself, we
highlight some of its distinguishing features. We also look at how our
Lord Jesus Christ spoke about and used the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We have called
this section <a href="claims.htm">Examining the Bible's
Testimony</a></p>

</li>
<li class="justify">
<p><b><i>The
Bible can be readily understood and applied to daily life by every
Christian.</i></b></p>
<p>Starting with an account of how a Bristol lady was healed of a
debilitating illness by copying parts of the Bible by hand, we invite
you to experience how the Scriptures can "speak" to you today.</p>
<p>We have
called this section <a href="testimony.htm">Experiencing
the Bible's Power</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these two
main sections there are six <a href="finding.htm">introductory</a>
pages, four concluding pages offering <a href="help.htm">further
help and thought</a>, and five <a href="research.htm">appendices</a>.
Every page in <span class="citw">Confidence
in the Word</span> has the single aim of
helping you to regain and increase your trust in the Bible.</p>

<h3>Navigating the Site</h3>

<p class="justify">While you are naturally
at liberty to visit the pages of <span class="citw">Confidence
in the Word</span> in any order you choose
(you may, for example, wish to explore the background to the site in
the <a href="#appendices">Appendices</a> before
venturing to the main
pages), we nevertheless believe that you will gain the greatest benefit
by working through the pages in the order shown above. To assist you
with this, the <i>Proceed to:</i> link at the foot of each
page
directs you to the next page in the group, or, in the case of the last
page of a group, the first page of the following group. The first <i>Return
to:</i>
link directs you back to the previous page, or, in the case of the
first page of a group, the last page of the previous group. Each page
also has a link returning you directly to the <a href="#sitemap">Site
Map</a>.
Where we have provided subsidiary pages (indented in the Site Map
above) the return links direct you back either to the previous
subsidiary page (if there is one) and/or to the related main page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="justify">On some
pages we refer you back to an item on a earlier page, or forward to a
section of a later page. These links are purely optional and are
intended only as guides. At the end of the section to which you are
referred, you will find a further link directing you back to the place
on the page from which you have come. We refer to this as the <i>Main
Text</i>.</p>
<p class="justify">We have also provided
a range of links,
including several Christian web directories. With only a few
exceptions, these may be accessed via our page of <a href="links.htm">Links to Other Websites</a>. In order
to avoid that page becoming unduly cumbersome we have not provided
return links to other pages within this site. You will therefore need
to click on the <i>Back</i> button on your browser in
order to return to the <i>Main Text</i>. However, we have
targetted all external links, so that wherever you are in the site you
are visiting you can return directly to this site simply by clicking
the <i>Close</i> button in the top right hand corner of
your browser (you do no have to go back through all the pages you have
visited).</p>

<p class="justify">All Bible references are
given in the form of live links
to the <a href="links.htm#gateway">Bible Gateway</a>,
where you can view the Scriptures in a variety of English versions and
a number of foreign languages. A selection of books from the Apocrypha
may be viewed in the <a href="http://www.bible.org/default.asp?scid=3" rel="external">NETBible</a>,
which also includes the entire Old and New Testaments. Our use of these
facilities is gratefully acknowledged (see <a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>

<h4>Our Prayer...</h4>

<p class="justify">...is that God will

routine from now on.</p>
<p class="justify">We pray too that every
visitor will be moved to put into practice what they read in the
Scriptures, and above all, to deepen their knowledge of our heavenly
Father, through his only Son, Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy
Spirit, to whom, One God in three Persons, be all praise forever and
forever!</p>
