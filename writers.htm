<h3>Moses ...</h3>

<i><b>Insights from the New Testament...</b></i></p>
<p>Moses' method of ratifying the covenant is highly significant as it reminds us of our Lord's action at the Last Supper (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26:27-28&language=english&version=NLT">Matthew 26:27-28</a>), and both the cost and benefits, of the redemption Christ has won for us (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10:11-12&language=english&version=NLT">Hebrews 10:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, both Old and New Covenants alike bear witness to the solemn fact that, <i>without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9:22&language=english&version=NLT">Hebrews 9:22</a>).</p>

<p>... records that he was first given the commandments verbally by God (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20:1; 20:22; 21:1&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 20:1, 22, 21:1</a>) - that is to say, God breathed them out. When Moses had conveyed them to the people he then wrote them down (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:3-4&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:3-4</a>). After completing this task he publicly read the newly composed <i>Book of the Covenant</i>, after which he ratified the agreement between the Lord and his people by sprinkling the blood from a sacrifice over them (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:7-8&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:7-8</a>). It was only on a subsequent encounter with the Lord that he was given the stone tablets which God himself had inscribed (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24:12;31:18&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 24:12 and 31:18</a>).</p>
<p>In a similar way, when God repeated his commands, he first of all gave them verbally to Moses (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34:10-26&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 34:10-26</a>), and only then writes them on the stone tablets which Moses had taken with him up Mount Sinai, as the Lord instructed him (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34:1-4;34:27-28&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 34:1-4 and 34:27-28</a>). The significant difference was that, although Moses had destroyed the original set of tablets in his anger at seeing the people's idolatry (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32:19&language=english&version=NLT">Exodus 32:19</a>), the <i>Book of the Covenant</i> would have still been intact. There was, therefore, no need for him to write it a second time. However, the stone tablets inscribed with the commandments - <i>the Testimony</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+31:18;32:15&language=english&version=NIV">Exodus 31:18 and 32:15 (NIV-UK)</a>) - needed to be replaced so there would be a tangible witness to the covenant God had made with his people.</p>
<p>Nearly forty years later, in preparation for the entry into Canaan, Moses wrote further collections of laws at God's instruction (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:9; 31:24-26&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:9 and 31:24-26)</a>), together with the words of the song he was to teach to the assembled people of Israel (see <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:19&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>, and <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:30-32:43&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 31:30-32:43</a> for the song itself). Moses' exhortation to the assembly of Israel after he had recited the song is applicable to all readers of any part of the Scriptures - <i>"These instructions are no mere words - they are your life!"</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+32:47&language=english&version=NLT">Deuteronomy 32:47)</a>. We therefore do well to take them to heart! </p>

<p>The conviction that they were handling the very words of God himself applied equally to what the prophets wrote (see for example <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+30:1-2;36:1-2&language=english&version=NLT">Jeremiah 30:1-2 and 36:1-2</a>), even, on one remarkable occasion, to the extent of reconstructing, and adding to, a manuscript that had been destroyed by the king of Judah (see <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+36:21-28; 36:32&language=english&version=NLT">Jeremiah 36:21-28 and 36:32</a>).</p>

<p>... was able clearly to distinguish between what was given to him by direct revelation from the Lord and what was the product of his own judgment, as he is at pains to point our in <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians+7:10-12&language=english&version=NLT">1 Corinthians 7:10-12</a>).<p>
<p>However, since even what Paul considered to be his <i>own</i> judgment was informed and guided by the Holy Spirit, it has been included as part of God's Word to us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Paul was also careful to distinguish between when he is transmitting what, even in the space of less than fifty years, had already become established as accepted tradition (as in <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians+11:23-26;15:3-7&language=english&version=NLT">1 Corinthians 11:23-26 and 15:3-7</a>), and when he was recording fresh revelation (as in <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Thessalonians+4:15-18&language=english&version=NLT">1 Thessalonians 4:15-18</a>). For this reason he was not ashamed of the message he preached (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1:16-17&language=english&version=NLT">Romans 1:16-17</a>) and rejoiced when it was received as it truly was (and is, and always will  be), God's own Word (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Thessalonians+2:13&language=english&version=NLT">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).</font></p>

<h3>John ...</h3>

In <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John+4:6&language=english&version=NLT">1 John 4:6</a> he offers a test for deciding between true and false teaching: what agreed with the teaching he had given was to be accepted as true: what did not agree with his teaching was to be rejected as false.</p>
<p>This was not because John was conceited, but simply because he knew that what he taught was the truth. He had been present when Jesus had spoken about the coming of the Holy Spirit (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:26;16:13-14&language=english&version=NLT">John 14:26 and 16:13-14</a>), which he, together with the other apostles and many other believers, had received at Pentecost (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2:1-4&language=english&version=NLT">Acts 2:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, John had the witness of his own hearing, sight and touch that what he was writing about was true (see <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John+1:1-5&language=english&version=NLT">1 John 1:1-5</a>).</p>

<dd>... whom many consider to be the same person as the apostle John, states that he wrote the Book of Revelation as a circular letter to the seven churches in the Province of Asia (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:4&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 1:4</a>) at the personal instruction of the Lord Jesus, <i>the living one who died</i> and who is now <i>alive forever and ever!</i> as a record of <i>the things that are now happening and ... will happen later</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:10-11;1:18-19&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 1:10-11 and 1:18-19</a>). John also records that the seven individual letters which immediately follow were written by direct dictation from the Lord (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:1;2:8;2:12;2:18;3:1;3:7;3:14&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 2:1, 2:8, 2:12, 2:18, 3:1, 3:7 and 3:14</a>).</p>
<p>John tells us there were three further occasions when he was directly commanded to write (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+14:13;19:9;21:5&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 14:13, 19:9 and 21:5</a>), but is also careful to record that there was one event he was forbidden to record (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+10:4&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 10:4</a>).</p>

<blockquote> 

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">John the Divine's testimony serves to remind us that God's Word is, quite literally, a divine revelation to the human race. We can know only as much about God and his purposes as he has chosen to reveal to us. To attempt to know more is futile (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+11:7-9&language=english&version=NLT">Job 11:7-9</a>), since God's thoughts and ways are incomprehensible to us (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55:8-9;Romans+11:33-36&language=english&version=NLT">Isaiah 55:8-9 and Romans 11:33-36</a>). Therefore, we must not attempt to add to, or subtract from, God's Word (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians+4:6&language=english&version=NIV">1 Corinthians 4:6 (NIV-UK)</a>) and <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22:18-19&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 22:18-19</a>). Yet, by a process we cannot begin to understand, God's Word - whether spoken or written - will always produce fruit, and accomplish what he intends for it everywhere he sends it (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55:10-11&language=english&version=NLT">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).</font></p>
