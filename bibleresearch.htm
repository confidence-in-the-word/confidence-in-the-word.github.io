represents its author's personal response to the challenge presented by the 
outcome of research into the personal Bible reading habits of Christians in 
England and Wales. From this and similar research in the USA, he has come to the 
conclusion that the underlying reason for the low level of personal Bible 
reading in the Western Hemisphere is because there has been a fundamental <i>
loss of confidence</i> in the Scriptures as the divinely inspired, authoritative 
and therefore completely trustworthy Word 
of God on the part of many of God's people, including many of their leaders. On 
this page we consider the picture the research presents, offer some of the many 
interpretations that have been placed upon it, and finally put forward our own 
conclusion and response. We have not written this page to convince you of our 
point of view, but merely to explain the <i>raison d'être</i> of <i>

<h5><font size="4">&nbsp;</font><font size 3>Bible Society</font></h5>

<p align="justify">Based on a random sample of regular churchgoers in England 
and Wales, a survey commissioned by this Society in 1997 showed that 16% - <i>
fewer than 1 in 5</i> - were in the habit of personally reading (or hearing 
read) something from the Bible every day, and that, including those who did read 
the Bible daily, only 1 in 4 (25%) read the Bible more than once a week. 
Overall, just over two-thirds (68%) had read at least something from the Bible 
during the past twelve months.</p>

<p align="justify">However, this meant that nearly a third (32%) had either not 
read anything from the Bible during the twelve months preceding the survey, or 
had never personally read the Scriptures at any time in their lives.</p>



<p align="justify"><font size="2">It should be emphasised that these figures 
relate only to private Bible reading by individuals. They do not include either 
reading the Bible or hearing it read as, for example, in Church services or 
study groups.</font><br>

<p align="justify">Although we have been asked not to divulge the exact figures, 
we can say that similar surveys commissioned by the Bible Society at varying intervals 
since the early 1980's show consistently similar results. The low level of 
personal Bible reading in England and Wales would therefore appear to be a 
long-standing situation which shows no sign of improvement, despite the many 
excellent attempts being made to encourage individual use of the Scriptures by 
Christian publishers and radio and television stations, and not least the Worldwide Web.</p>

<p align="justify">An ad-hoc survey conducted by this Christian publisher during a number of

and <i>keen</i>, on average less than 10% of the congregation read the Bible 
every day, and only 30% - fewer than 1 in 3 - were reading it at all during the 
week. The survey also reports that <i>the situation was worse with parents 
reading the Bible with their children - most were not!</i></p>

						<h5><font size="4">&nbsp;<a name="Interpreting_">Interpreting
						</a>the Research</font></h5></font>
					



<p align="justify">What has brought about the situation in which fewer than a 
fifth of professing Christians and only three percent of the entire adult 
population in England and Wales read the Bible every day? In passing we may remind ourselves that this 
is the part of the world which first 
gave the Bible to the English-speaking peoples in their own tongue, and in which 
the modern missionary and Bible Society movements both originated.
<p align="justify">Many reasons have been put forward 
for the low level of personal Bible reading in England and Wales. Here we offer just 
a selection 
of them:<ul><font face="Maiandra GD">
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2">Among the population as a whole, Christian 
	and non-Christian alike, the demands on 
	people's time, and the replacement of a predominantly literary culture by a 
	mainly visual, non-book culture, are claimed to be largely responsible. It is 
	said that many homes today do not possess any books, let alone a Bible. 
	Again, it is claimed that the use of icons instead of written directions in public places 
	contributes to a reduction in the general level of 
	literacy and the development of an increasingly image-based culture. 
	However, research by the Bible Society indicates that three-quarters of the adult 
	population claims to have at least one Bible in their household, and the 
	current vogue of fantasy adventure books for both adults and children would 
	also seem to indicate that book ownership is on the increase rather than 
	decrease.</font><br>
<br>
    	<li>
		<p align="justify"><font size="2">The trend in recent years within much 
		of the UK Church towards an increasingly people centred, experiential, and feelings 
		orientated spirituality is said to have produced a move away from the 
		former emphasis on knowledge and understanding as the basis for faith. 
		In such a spiritual climate the reading and exposition of the 
		Scriptures has, in some circles, been either significantly reduced, or 
		even dispensed with entirely. It is claimed that many now look upon 
		personal Bible reading as merely an &quot;optional extra&quot;. In charismatic 
		churches in particular, the emphasis placed upon non-scriptural worship 
		songs and spontaneous &quot;words from the Lord&quot; are also said to have 
		detracted from the Bible's former pre-eminence.</font><br>
<br>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2">Taken together, both the foregoing 
	influences tend to work 
	not only against Christianity, but also Judaism, since both faiths rely 
	primarily on an objective literary revelation rather than subjective 
	mystical or emotional experiences. Indeed, the God of the Bible expressly 
	forbids the making of images (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Exodus+20:4&language=English&version=NLT">Exodus 
	20:4</a>) since he can be understood as existing only as <i>Word</i>, and 
	therefore reveals himself to mankind through words, not images (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:1&language=English&version=NIV">John 
	1:1 (NIV-UK)</a>).<br>
	In saying this, however, we have no intention of denying 
	that God has also revealed his nature through creation (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+1:19-20&language=		English&version=NLT">Romans 
	1:19-20</a>), nor that in his incarnation Jesus Christ was indeed the Word 
	of God made visible and tangible in the form of a human being (<a 	href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:14&language=English&version=NIV">John 
	1:14 (NIV-UK)</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Colossians+1:15&language=English&version=NLT">
	Colossians 1:15</a>).
	
	</font>
	
	<br>
&nbsp;</p><li>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2">The religious diversity arising from the influx of other 
	races into Britain, and the active promotion of pluralism in our educational 
	institutions, and society as a whole, in the name of &quot;cultural diversity&quot; and &quot;racial 
	tolerance&quot; has detracted from the perception of Christianity as a unique 
	faith, and in particular the conviction that the Bible is God's only 
	authentic written revelation to mankind. In such a pluralistic environment 
	the Bible becomes merely one holy book among many, considered to be 
	on a par with the holy writings of other faiths, such as Islam and Hinduism.</font><br>
	<br> 
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2">Three further reasons advanced, more particularly by some 
	evangelicals, are: <br>
      	</font>
      	<ul type="disc">
        <li>
		<p align="justify"><font size="2">The progressive &quot;downgrading&quot; of the Scriptures at 
		the hands of liberal theologians. According to this view, the process began in the nineteenth century 
		and continues unabated to the present day. It is said to have been 
		responsible for many thinking people (Christian and non-Christian alike) entertaining serious doubts about the Bible's authority 
		and reliability; <br>
		</font>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2">The idea, advanced in more recent years, that the 
	Bible 	<i>contains</i> the Word of God but is not itself the Word of God, 
	rather in the way a fruit bowl may contain apples or oranges but is not itself 
	the fruit. Discernment given by the Holy Spirit, it is said, is required to 
	distinguish between those parts of the Bible which are the authentic Word of 
	God and those which are merely the receptacle (ie those parts merely 
	reflecting the cultural situation at the time of writing and which, therefore, 
	cannot apply to contemporary society). According to this view, Scripture <i>
	becomes</i> the Word of God to the reader only as the Holy Spirit shows it 
	to be such. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font size="1" face="Maiandra GD"><a name="consider">We consider<a/>

&nbsp;</font><li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Maiandra GD" size="2">The inference, given by some 
		Bible expositors, that it is only the theologically trained who can 
		properly understand and interpret the Scriptures. As a letter to
		<i>Evangelicals Now</i> expressed it, the outcome of this stance is that, <i>...the 
		Reformed doctrine of the perspicuity of Scripture is wrested away from 
		the ordinary Christian, who becomes dependent on a 'Priest-caste' of 
		(historically critical) scholars. </i>[Letter from Mr J Barrett, 
		London, in

		<p>

		<p align="justify">Some consider that what has happened is that the pre-Reformation 
		believer's dependence on the sacrificing priest of Roman Catholicism has 
		been replaced in some Protestant traditions by a similar dependence on 
		specialist Bible teachers; a dependence, it is claimed, largely 
		generated by the teachers themselves in order to justify their position 
		and enhance their status and influence.</font><font face="Maiandra GD">

<p align="justify">We hasten to add that, although the factors we have identified may all be valid

<p align="justify">The author is equally convinced that the loss of confidence in the Bible as the 
Word of God has been accompanied by a loss of confidence on the part of many

nourishment for the life of faith, under the direction of the Holy Spirit alone.</p>

<p align="justify">The picture revealed by the research he has consulted, 
the reasons he has seen advanced to explain the present situation, together with 
the convictions he has formed as a result of his own experience and 
reflection, have given rise to the author's abiding concern to help his fellow 
Christians to strengthen their individual <font color="#0000FF"> <i>Confidence in the Word</i></font>, 
so they may personally read and benefit from the Bible every day of their life. 
</p>
<p align="center">It is this concern that has provided the inspiration and motivation for this website.</p>
