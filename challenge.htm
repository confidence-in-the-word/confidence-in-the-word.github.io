<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John Rogers, Puritan minister of Dedham, Essex in the year 1620, preached a memorable sermon on the theme of making the Bible an important part of daily life, at the same time allowing himself some pulpit dramatics.</p>
<p>First, he portrayed God addressing the congregation and saying: "I have trusted you so long with my Bible, but you have slighted it: it lies in your houses covered over with cobwebs, you care not to listen to it. Because of this you shall have my Bible no longer."</p>
<p>Removing the huge pulpit Bible from its place, he covered it over with a cloth, then kneeling down in the pulpit he impersonated the people crying: "Oh God, whatever you do, don't take the Bible away from us. Take our children, burn our houses, destroy our goods, but spare us the Bible."</p>
<p>Then, acting as God again, he said: "Say you so? Well, I will try you a little while longer." Replacing the Bible onto the reading desk, he said: "I will see from now on how you use it, whether you love it more, observe it more, practise it more, and live more according to it."</p>
<p>The result of this? The whole congregation dissolved in tears. Thomas Goodwin, who was an eyewitness to this occasion, said that he was compelled to hang for a quarter of an hour upon the neck of his horse weeping before he had power to mount, so strange an impression was there upon him and generally upon the people.</p>
<p>John Rogers had touched upon a very sensitive spot, for Puritanism, whatever else it might have had against it and with all its flaws, it was a Bible movement. They saw reverence of God as reverence for his Word, service for God as obeying his Word and disregard of Scripture as the greatest possible insult to its divine author. But should not all decades be like that?

<h4>God's Word for Today?</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>What, we wonder, would the reaction of the average 21st century congregation be to an appeal such as John Rogers made? Would it still have the same effect as in 1620? Or have we in the UK - even those of us who profess to be Christians - in the first decade of the new millennium moved so far away from the Bible that words spoken as from the Lord would fall on deaf ears and leave hearts unmoved?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We do not offer these thoughts to point the finger or to condemn, but as a challenge to all who claim to love the Lord to regain the same degree of <i><b>Confidence in the Word</i></b> as was shown by our forefathers. May the Lord of the Scriptures help his people in our time to become once again what they were at heart in John Roger's day - <i>people of the Book</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We believe this is an urgent matter, for we dare to suggest that unless we take to heart the challenge given by John Rogers, the time may not be far distant when God will send upon the entire Western world <i>not a famine of bread or water but of hearing the words of the Lord.</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+8:11-13&language=english&version=NLT">Amos 8:11-13</a>).</td>

<p>In <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:3&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation 1:3</a> we read that:</p>

<i>The Word of the Prophets</i></p>
The word <i>prophecy</i> as used in the Bible includes not only predictions about the future, but also the proclamation of any word from God whether of direction, correction, narration, instruction or comfort. In particular, it refers to the interpretation of current events as given by direct revelation of the Holy Spirit. Prophecy is never the result of the prophets' own diagnosis of a situation, as is clear from <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Peter+1:19-21&language=english&version=NIV">2 Peter 1:19-21 (NIV-UK)</a>.</td>

<p>Although, in context, this statement applies only to the Book of Revelation, by applying the general rule that what is true of any part of Scripture is true of the whole, it may by extension be legitimately applied to the entire Bible.</font></p>

<p>Scripture reading indeed brings many blessings to those who practice it regularly. The apostle Paul, writing to the Christians at Rome, says that the things written in the Scriptures long ago not only teach us, but also, <i>give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15:4&language=english&version=NLT">Romans 15:4</a>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But, as with so many of God's promises, there is a condition to be met! Look at that verse from <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:3&language=english&version=NLT">Revelation</a> again. Who is it that God blesses?  <i>All who listen to it (that is, his Word) and obey what it says.</i> We not only need to read the Bible and take note of what it says but, above all, to put it into practice.</p>  

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Do you remember what the apostle James says? He says that the person who looks into the Bible but fails to do anything about what they hear God saying to them, is like someone who looks in a mirror and then goes away and does nothing to improve their appearance. In fact they even forget what they look like! No, he says, God's Word is something to be acted upon and not merely heard (or read) (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:22-24&language=english&version=NLT">James 1:22-24</a>).</p>

<p><i>But</i> - James adds - <i>if you keep looking steadily into God's perfect law - the law that sets you free - and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it</i> (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:25&language=english&version=NLT">James 1:25</a>).</p>
