<h4>Biography</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Born just three months before the outbreak of the Second World War, Michael grew 
up in the Midlands and south-east London. After leaving school in 1957 he trained as a cost accountant in a light engineering 
company 
in north Kent, and continued working with various engineering concerns for 
fourteen years, followed by seven years in music publishing. In 1978 
Michael joined the <a href="links.htm#bibsoc">Bible Society</a> where he served in a financial capacity for 
very nearly fifteen years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Working for the Bible Society greatly increased Michael's love for the 
Scriptures, and he gradually developed a concern to help others value and use 
the Bible more. In 1988, the  Church Michael then attended sponsored him for a 
week-long Institute in Biblical Studies at
<a href="http://www.waverleyabbeyhouse.org.uk/">Waverley Abbey</a>. This proved a formative experience, 
and he returned home convinced that the remainder of his life's work would be inextricably bound up with the Bible. Two years later, during a period of illness, 
Michael vowed that should the Lord spare his life, he would devote the 
rest of his 
days to helping people to know, love, understand and use the Scriptures. <a name="the">The</a> <a href="research.htm">research</a> into personal Bible use he encountered 
while at Bible Society prompted him to compile 
<i><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Confidence in the Word </font></b></i>as an <i>opus dei</i> 
as a part of fulfilling his vow.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Maiandra GD">
<a name="Michael">Michael</a> 
initially began to develop <font color="white"><b><i>Confidence in the Word</i></b></font> 
as an introductory course for a proposed Bible School for which he continues to hold a vision (see <a href="author.htm#hope">Hopes and Dreams</a>). 
When initial feedback from those with whom he shared the idea proved discouraging, 
<a name="it_was">it was</a> 
Michael's wife, <a href=#wife>Ann<a/>, who suggested he should instead offer 
the course to the world in the form of a website.</a></font></font></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Since leaving Bible Society in April 1993,
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2Timothy+2:15&language=english&version=NIV">
2 Timothy 2:15</a> has become Michael's "job description". In order to increase 
his competence in handling the Scriptures he studied for a diploma of theology with Bible Ministry College and was subsequently ordained by the College 
in 1997. Michael has also has trained to teach the <a href="links.htm#wtb">Walk Thru' the Bible</a> 
Old Testament seminar, and broadcast a short series of Bible studies on <a href="links.htm#twr">Trans World Radio-UK</a>. In 2000 
and 2004, he helped arrange public readings of the Scriptures at
<a href="links.htm#rcbc">Rodbourne Cheney Baptist Church</a> and was also an Editor and Examination Secretary for
<a href="links.htm#goteach">Go Teach Publications</a> for some years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In 2003, Michael decided to retire from accountancy in order to be fully available to the Lord.&nbsp;As well as developing <font color="#FFFFFF"><b><i>Confidence 
in the Word</i></b></font> he has also renewed his association with TWR, by auditioning US-sourced programmes prior to transmission in the UK, until the relocation of the Bath studio early in 2006. His current activities include assisting in the ministry of his local church (which is without a minister at the moment), including preaching and leading public services, and maintaining the Church's website. He hopes that, in the fullness of time, he may realise 
his long held ambition to get to grips with New Testament Greek as well as continue to deepen his knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures. Michael may 
also be seen behind the counter at the
<a href="http://www.lighthousebooks.net/index.html" target="blank">Lighthouse Bookshop</a> in Highworth, usually on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">For some time Michael has nursed an ambition to write a book 
which would help men to be strong in the Lord in their latter years. He is 
also keen to help recently retired men and women, and those contemplating 
retirement, to renew their sense of vocation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Although he may now be &quot;retired&quot; in the eyes of the world, yet, despite some continuing health problems, Michael 
considers himself &quot;refired&quot;  for the Lord's work! 
His constant prayer is: <i>&quot;Show me the path 
where I should walk, O Lord: point out the right road for me to follow. Lead me by your truth and teach me, for you are the God who saves me. All day long I put my hope in you&quot; </i>&nbsp;(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Psalms+25:4-5&language=english&version=NLT">Psalm 25:4-5</a>). 
Although at times he is very conscious that, physically, he is growing older, 
Michael is equally certain that his
<i>inner being is being renewed every day</i> (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2 Corinthians+4:16&language=english&version=NLT">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<br>
</p>

<h4>Spiritual History</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Michael grew up in a church-going home, 
being baptised in infancy and  confirmed at 14 while a choirboy at his Parish Church. 
Confirmation made a deep impression on him, and the associated discipline of regular communion taught him the importance of individual responsibility in spiritual matters. His first meaningful encounter with the Scriptures took place in his early twenties, when he was introduced to the then newly published translation of the 
complete New Testament by <a href="links.htm#phillips">J B Phillips</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">However, Michael dates his &quot;evangelical conversion&quot; from February 1971, when he was almost 32. While preparing an essay on the atonement, during training as a Reader 
in the Church of England, he became convinced  that Jesus Christ had died for him personally and  that all he needed to do in order to be saved was simply to accept this fact in faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Rather like John Wesley, on that unforgettable May evening at Aldersgate in 1738, Michael found his heart <i>strangely warmed</i> and received an 
inner assurance of salvation, and a baptism in the Holy Spirit, which have never since left him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Water baptism by immersion in 1989 proved another milestone in Michael's spiritual journey, for it released the Lord's ability to enable 
him to <i>grow in the special favour and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</i> (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2Peter+3:18&language=english&version=NLT">2 Peter 3:18</a>).</p>

<p align="justify"><font face="verdana" size="1">In addition to his aspirations to authorship and further study, since 1998 Michael has held a vision for a permanent Bible School in Swindon where &quot;ordinary&quot; believers can receive guidance and encouragement to help them

believers. The aim of the School would be to provide practical help with reading 
and understanding the Bible and applying the Scriptures to everyday life.</font></p>

<p align="justify">Michael sees this as a small contribution towards overcoming
