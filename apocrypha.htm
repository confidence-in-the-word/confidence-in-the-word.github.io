<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The title <b>Apocrypha</b> comes from a Greek word meaning <i>
concealed</i> or <i>hidden away</i>. It was first applied by Jerome (c340-420AD) 
because the books concerned were not included in the original Hebrew canon of Scripture. Following Jerome, the Protestant Reformers took the view 
that they were of lesser value than those generally accepted as Scripture. <a name="introduction">At</a> around the same time, the Roman Catholic Church fixed the number of books in the Old Testament Apocrypha at fourteen, and it is these books we list in the <a href=#table>table</a> on this page. These books 
are also sometimes referred to as the <b>Deuterocanonical</b> <b>books</b>, meaning second (or secondary) canon. 
This term is applied when they are inserted in the main body of the Old 
Testament, as is the general practice in Roman Catholic Bibles.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">There is also an collection of apocryphal books for the New Testament. This is a rather indefinite body of writings, including some additional "gospels" and 
&quot;letters&quot; attributed mainly to various New Testament personalities. However, these have never commanded any measure of general acceptance, and are not included on this page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In addition, a wider collection of books also exists, dating from the period between 
the Old and New Testaments, composed mostly by Jews. Although preserved by the early 
Christians, these have never been as highly regarded as the Old Testament Apocrypha. This group of books is sometimes referred to as the <b>Pseudepigrapha</b>. It includes the <i>Book of 
Enoch</i> from which Jude quotes in <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+14-15&language=english&version=NLT">Jude 14-15</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="1">(Because a biblical writer includes a quotation in his writing, this does not necessarily mean the quotation is inspired, as for example when the apostle Paul quotes from a Greek poet when addressing the Athenian Areopagus (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17:28&language=english&version=NLT">Acts 17:28</a>).)</font></td>

<h3><a name="History">History </a>of the Apocrypha</h3>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify">Christians have disputed over this group of books since earliest times. 
Indeed, this dispute goes back to even before the Christian era. Although they never formed part of the original Hebrew canon of Scripture, they were gradually included in the Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures (the <i>Septuagint</i>), and, after some initial hesitation, also in the Latin version derived from it (the <i>Vulgate</i>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The <b>Septuagint</b> was a translation made initially for the benefit of the Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria around 200 BC. The name is derived from the Latin for 
<i>seventy</i> as tradition holds it was prepared by a team of seventy-two 
translators, consisting of six elders from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
The Septuagint is particularly important to readers and students of the New 
Testament because not only is it the version of the Old Testament most 
frequently quoted by the writers of the New, but it also established many of the 
words used by the New Testament writers when referring to Old Testament 
institutions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The <b>Vulgate</b> became the official Latin version of the Scriptures in the Western Church until the Reformation. It was made by 
(or under the direction of) Jerome in consultation with 
Jewish teachers, and drew heavily on Jewish tradition. Although Jerome at first excluded the 
<i>apocryphal </i>books, as he called them, on the grounds that they did not appear in the Hebrew canon, he was later persuaded to include them. It was only from the thirteenth century onwards that, perhaps rather ironically, Jerome's translation became known as the 
<i>Vulgate</i>, 
deriving its name from the Latin word <i>vulgare </i>meaning "to make common", something it 
signally failed to do, since by that time Latin was the language only of the educated classes.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify">At the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church decided (1546) to continue to include most of the Apocrypha in its Bibles. 
However, because of their rather uncertain pedigree, many of the Reformers thought the books were not truly Scripture in the same way as the Old and New Testaments. Others, including Luther and The Church of England, took a middle course. 
So for example, Article 6 of the Church of England's <b>39 Articles</b> states that the books may be <i>read for instruction of manners</i> 
(that is, to determine Christian conduct) but not used <i>to establish any doctrine</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Although the Apocrypha was included in the  Authorised Version of 
1611, largely because of its familiarity, it was relegated to a separate section between the Old and New Testaments, 
and in those versions which include it, this has been its almost invariable position in Protestant Bibles 
ever since. In Roman Catholic Bibles the books are normally retained in the main body of the Old Testament, where they are referred to as the 
<i>Deuterocanonical </i> (= second canon [or secondary]) books.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Both the Greek and Russian Orthodox traditions 
accept all the apocryphal books recognised by the Roman church as forming part 
of the their canons of Scripture, together with certain additional books, as we 
note below the main table in our next section.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The text of the
<a href="//www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html" target="blank">Decree of the Council of 
Trent</a>, which affirmed the books of the Apocrypha as canonical in the sight 
of the Roman Catholic Church, may be viewed in both Latin and English.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">For those who wish to explore 
the origin of the Apocrypha and the issue of canonicity from the Protestant standpoint more fully, we recommend the articles

<p style="text-align: justify">There is little consistency between versions as to the order or exact titles of the 
books constituting the Apocrypha. Our table attempts to place the books into logical 
groups. The titles we have shown represent an eclectic list based generally on those adopted by the New Revised Standard
