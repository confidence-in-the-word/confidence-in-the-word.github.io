<h3>The Research</h3>

<blockquote>

<h4>Bible Society</h4>

<p>Based on a random sample of regular churchgoers in England and Wales, a survey commissioned by this Society in 1997 showed that 16% - <i>fewer than 1 in 5</i> - were in the habit of personally reading (or hearing read) something from the Bible every day, and that, including those who did read the Bible daily, only 1 in 4 (25%) read the Bible more than once a week. Overall, just over two-thirds (68%) had read at least something from the Bible during the past twelve months.</p>

<p>However, this meant that nearly a third (32%) had either not read anything from the Bible during the twelve months preceding the survey, or had never personally read the Scriptures at any time in their lives.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It needs to be emphasised that these figures relate only to private Bible reading by individuals. They do not include either reading the Bible or hearing it read as, for example, in Church services or study groups.</font></p>

<p>Translated into terms of the population of England and Wales as a whole, this means that <i>only 3 out of every 100 adults</i> are in the habit or reading the Bible privately each day, and that <i>nearly two-thirds</i> of the adult population <b>(64% = 26.4 million)</b> have not personally read anything from the Scriptures for a year or more.</p>

<h4>The Good Book Company</h4>

<p>An ad-hoc survey conducted by this Christian publisher during a number of Church meetings in 2000 showed that, even in churches described as <i>sound</i> and <i>keen</i>, on average less than 10% of the congregation read the Bible every day, and only 30% - fewer than 1 in 3 - were reading it at all during the week. The survey also reports that <i>the situation was worse with parents reading the Bible with their children - most were not!</i></p>

<h3>Interpreting the Research</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i><b><font color="white">What has brought about the situation in which fewer than a fifth of professing Christians, and only three percent of the entire adult population, read the Bible every day in a part of the world which has more translations of the Scriptures in its principal native language than most others?</i></b></font> (We may also remind ourselves that it is the same part of the world which first gave the Bible to the English-speaking peoples in their own tongue, and in which the modern missionary and Bible Society movements both originated.)

<p>Many reasons have been put forward. Here we offer just some of them:</p>

<ul><font face="Arial" size="2">
	<li>Among the population as a whole, the demands upon people's 	time, and the replacement of a predominantly literary culture 	by a mainly visual, non-book culture are claimed to be largely 	responsible. It is said that many homes today do not possess 	any books, let alone a Bible. Again, the use of icons instead 	of written directions in public places 	contributes, so it is 	claimed, to a reduction in the general level of literacy and 	the development of an increasingly image-based culture. 	However, Bible Society research indicates that three-quarters 	of the adult population claims to have at least one Bible in 	their household, and the current vogue of fantasy adventure 	books for both adults and children, would also seem to indicate 	that book ownership is on the increase, rather than 		decrease.<br>
<br>
    	<li>Within the Christian church, the trend in recent years 	towards an increasingly people centred, experiential and 	feelings orientated spirituality is said to have produced a 	move away from 	the former emphasis on knowledge and 		understanding as the basis for faith. In such a spiritual 	climate, the reading and exposition of the Scriptures has, in 	some circles, either been significantly reduced or even 	dispensed with entirely. It is claimed that many now look upon 	personal Bible reading as merely an "optional extra". In 	charismatic churches in particular, the emphasis placed upon 	non-scriptural worship songs and spontaneous "words from the 	Lord" are also 	said to have detracted from the the Bible's 	former pre-eminence.<br>
<br>
	<li>Taken together, both of the foregoing tend to work against 	not only Christianity, but also Judaism, since 	both faiths 	rely primarily on an objective literary revelation rather than 	subjective mystical or emotional experiences. Indeed, the God 	of the Bible expressly forbids the making of images (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20:4&language=English&version=NLT">Exodus 20:4</a>) since he can be understood as 	existing only as <i>Word</i>, and therefore reveals himself to 	mankind through words, not images (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1:1&language=English&version=NIV">John 1:1 (NIV)</a>).</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><font size="2">In saying this, however, we have no 		intention of denying that God has also revealed his nature 	through creation (<a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1:19-20&language=		English&version=NLT">Romans 1:19-20</a>), nor that in his 	incarnation Jesus Christ was indeed the Word of God made 	visible and tangible in the form of a human being (<a 	href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1:14&language=English&version=NIV">John 1:14 (NIV)</a> and <a href="//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1:15&language=English&version=NLT">Colossians 1:15</a>).</font>
	</blockquote>
	<li>The religious diversity arising from the influx of other 	races into Britain, and the active promotion of pluralism in 	our schools, colleges and society in the name of "cultural 	diversity" and "racial 	tolerance", has detracted from the 	perception of Christianity as a unique faith, and in particular 	the conviction that the Bible is God's only authentic written 	revelation to mankind. In such a pluralistic environment the 	Bible becomes merely one holy book among many, and is 		considered to be on a par with the holy writings of other 	faiths, such as Islam and Hinduism.<br>
	<br> 
	<li>Three further reasons advanced, more particularly by some 		evangelicals, are: <br>
<br>
      	<ul type="disc">
        <li>The progressive "downgrading" of the Scriptures at the 	hands of liberal theologians. This began in the nineteenth 	century and continues unabated up to the present day. It is 	said to have been responsible for many thinking people 		(Christian as well as non-Christian) entertaining serious 	doubts about the Bible's authority and reliability; <br>
	<br>
	<li>The idea, put forward in more recent years, that the Bible 	<i>contains</i> the Word of God, but is not itself the Word of 	God, in the way as a fruitbowl may contain apples or oranges, 	but is not itself the fruit. Discernment given by the Holy 	Spirit, it is said, is required to distinguish between 	those 	parts of the Bible which are the authentic Word of God 	and 	those which are merely the receptacle (ie those parts which 	merely reflect the cultural situation at the time of writing 	and which, therefore, no longer apply to contemporary society). 	According to this view, Scripture <i>becomes</i> the Word of 	God to the reader only as the Holy Spirit shows it to be 	such.</p>
	<p><font size="1"><a name="consider">(We consider<a/> another 	aspect of this doctrine in connection with Martin Luther's view 	of the Bible as a sacred ark in which the Word of God is 	preserved for us when asking of the Bible <a href="word.htm#luther">Whose Word?</a>)</font>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>The inference, given by some Bible expositors, that it is 	only the theologically trained who can properly understand and 	interpret the Scriptures. As a letter to <i>Evangelicals 	Now</i> expressed it, the outcome is that, <i>...the Reformed 	doctrine of the perspicuity of Scripture is wrested away from 	the ordinary Christian, who becomes dependent on a 		'Priest-caste' of (historically critical) scholars.</i><font 	size="1">[Source: Letter from Mr J Barrett, London, in 		<i>Evangelicals Now</i>, March 1998.]</font></p>

	<p>Some consider that what has happened is that the 		pre-reformation believer's dependence on the sacrificing priest 	of Roman Catholicism has been replaced in some Protestant 	traditions by a similar dependence on specialist Bible teachers 	- a dependence, so it is claimed, largely generated by the 	teachers themselves in order to justify their position and 	enhance their status and influence.</font>
      </ul>

<a name="conclusion"><h3>Conclusion</h3></a>

<blockquote>

<a name="emphasise"><p>As we emphasise</a> in the introduction to our <a href="home.htm#author">Home Page</a>, whatever other factors may or may not be involved, the <a href="author.htm">author</a> of this website has formed the settled conviction that the underlying reason why such a small proportion of people in England and Wales (including habitual churchgoers) privately read the Bible (or hear it read) with any degree of regularity, is because <i>they have suffered a fundamental loss of confidence in the Bible as the divinely inspired and completely trustworthy Word of God</i>. This loss of confidence has affected many otherwise deeply committed Christians - men and women, young and old, ordained and lay alike. This is confirmed by John Grayston, Scripture Union's Director of Bible Ministries, who recently stated that, as a result of the modern scholastic approach to the Bible, there has been <i>a loss of credibility in the scriptures themselves, which has left people wondering whether they are believable.</i> <font face="Arial" size="1">[Source: news item entitled <i>The forgotten practice of reading the Bible</i>, in <i>The Church of England Newspaper</i> (online version), 12 December, 2002].</font></p>

<p>The author is equally convinced the loss of confidence in the Bible as the Word of God has been accompanied by a loss of confidence on the part of many Christians, including many ministers, in their ability (and indeed their right) to read, understand and apply the Bible for themselves as their daily guide and nourishment for the life of faith, under the direction of the Holy Spirit alone.</p>
